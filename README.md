# Mobile asap Design System

## Architecture

Atomic Design is a methodology for creating design systems, introduced by Brad Frost in 2013. It's based on the idea that complex user interfaces can be broken down into smaller, more manageable parts called atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages. Here's a breakdown of each level:

1. **Atoms**: These are the basic building blocks of a design system, such as buttons, inputs, labels, and icons. Atoms are the smallest units and cannot be broken down further without losing their meaning.

2. **Molecules**: Molecules are groups of atoms bonded together. For example, a search form consisting of a text input field, a button, and a label can be considered a molecule.

3. **Organisms**: Organisms are more complex components that are made up of molecules and/or atoms. Examples include navigation bars, headers, and footers.

4. **Templates**: Templates represent the structure of a page or a layout. They define the overall arrangement of organisms, molecules, and atoms on a page without specifying the actual content.

5. **Pages**: Pages are instances of templates where real content is inserted. They are the final output that users interact with.

The Atomic Design methodology promotes a modular and systematic approach to design, which facilitates scalability, consistency, and maintainability across projects. It also encourages collaboration between designers and developers by providing a common language and framework for discussing and implementing design systems.
